        I'm Corinne Kelly -- a passionate Software Engineer Manager and
        Solutions Architect
      </h5>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineering leader with over 8 years of experience
        building scalable platforms, intuitive user experiences, and
        high-performing engineering teams. I specialize in frontend and backend
        development using JavaScript (Vue, React) and Python, and I've led
        cross-functional initiatives that improved user engagement, system
        performance, and business outcomesâ€”including reducing churn by 16% and
        boosting enrollment by 5%.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a manager and architect, I'm passionate about mentoring engineers,
        shaping thoughtful technical strategy, and driving product-aligned
        innovation. Whether it's modernizing infrastructure, improving API
        performance, or launching new user-facing features, I focus on
        delivering solutions that are both technically sound and user-centric.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently based in San Diego, I thrive in environments that value craft,
        curiosity, and collaboration.
